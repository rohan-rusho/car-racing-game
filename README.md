## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

* Game starts with a main menu offering difficulty choices.
* The player's car is fixed at the bottom of the screen and can move left/right.
* Enemy cars fall from the top of the screen at increasing speeds based on the selected difficulty.
* Collision detection ends the game and displays the Game Over screen.
* The score is incremented for every enemy car avoided.
* The highest score is saved in `best_score.txt` and loaded each session.
